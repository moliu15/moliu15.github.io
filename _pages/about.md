About me
======

Hi! I am Mo Liu, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I am advised by [Zuo-Jun (Max) Shen](https://shen.ieor.berkeley.edu/). I am also fortunate to work with [Paul Grigas](https://grigas.ieor.berkeley.edu/). Prior to joining Berkeley, I received my B.S. degree in Industrial Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2019.


Research Interest
======

My research interests include _data-driven decision-making_ and _machine learning_ (specifically statistical learning and active learning), with applications in _operations management_. I am particularly interested in _decision-focused learning_, a methodology that designs and trains prediction models to account for decision-making in downstream optimization problems. These downstream problems include real-world applications in revenue management, such as product recommendation, assortment optimization and inventory management.

* **Methodologies**:
  Statistical learning, active learning, decision-focused learning.

* **Applied Area**:
  Revenue management, pricing, supply chain management.

ðŸŽ‰ I will join the Department of Statistics and Operations Research at UNC Chapel Hill in the fall of 2024.
