Hi! I am Mo Liu, a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at the University of California, Berkeley. I am advised by [Zuo-Jun (Max) Shen](https://shen.ieor.berkeley.edu/). I also work with [Paul Grigas](https://grigas.ieor.berkeley.edu/). Prior to joining Berkeley, I received my B.S. degree in Industrial Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2019.


Research Interest
======

I am interested in developing and analyzing efficient algorithms to build prediction models for the decision-making under various applications. Particularly, I am interested in the setting where the labels of the samples are costly to acquire, and the prediction models are used to make decisions in a downstream problem. In this setting, the prediction models are evaluated by the cost of the downstream problem, instead of the prediction errors. 

In methodologies, I am  interested in statistical learning, active learning, and predict-then-optimize.

In applications, I am interested in revenue management, pricing, and supply chain management.
