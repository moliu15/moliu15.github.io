About me
======

Hi! I am Mo Liu, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at the University of California, Berkeley. I am advised by [Zuo-Jun (Max) Shen](https://shen.ieor.berkeley.edu/). I am also fortunate to work with [Paul Grigas](https://grigas.ieor.berkeley.edu/). Prior to joining Berkeley, I received my B.S. degree in Industrial Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2019.


Research Interest
======

My research interests include data-driven decision making and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in decision-focused learning: settings where a machine learning model is built to make decisions in the downstream optimization problem. In this setting, the prediction models are evaluated by the cost of the downstream problem, instead of the prediction errors.

* In methodologies, I am interested in statistical learning, active learning, and predict-then-optimize approach.

* In applications, I am interested in revenue management, pricing, supply chain management and healthcare.
