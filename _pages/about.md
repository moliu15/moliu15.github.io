About me
======

Hi! I am Mo Liu, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of [Industrial Engineering and Operations Research](https://ieor.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I am advised by [Zuo-Jun (Max) Shen](https://shen.ieor.berkeley.edu/). I am also fortunate to work with [Paul Grigas](https://grigas.ieor.berkeley.edu/). Prior to joining Berkeley, I received my B.S. degree in Industrial Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2019.


Research Interest
======

My research interests include _data-driven decision making_ and _machine learning_. Specifically, I am interested in _decision-focused learning_: settings where a machine learning model is built to make decisions in the downstream optimization problem. In this setting, the prediction models are evaluated by the risk of the downstream problem, instead of the prediction errors.

* **Methodologies**:
  Statistical learning, active learning, and decision-focused learning.

* **Applications**:
  Revenue management, pricing, supply chain management and healthcare.
