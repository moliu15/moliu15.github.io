## Research papers

1. **Decision-Focused Bias Correction for Fluid Approximation**
	Can Er, **Mo Liu**. To be submitted. [\[link\]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15726)

   * **"Fluid approximation is biased with respect to the decision-making"**
   * Should one plug in the time-varying arrival rate to replace the original demand arrival distribution when designing the capacity for multi-server system? (Short answer: No)
   * Does a decision-corrected fluid approximation always exist? (Short answer: No)
   * Does a (vectorized) point prediction exist for multi-product multi-customer newsvendor problem? (Short answer: No)
   * We provide sufficient and necessary conditions for the exsitence of the decision-corrected arrival rate.

1. **Marginal Value of One Data Point in Assortment Personalization**  
   **Mo Liu**, Junyu Cao, Zuo-jun Max Shen. Resubmitted to _Management Science_.

   * **"How much is the marginal contribution to the revenue increase when adding one new customer with some specific feature into the training set?"**
   * By evaluating this marginal contribution of each customer, we are able to identify informative customers and reduce the size of the training set by about 80% while maintaining the same level of revenue.
