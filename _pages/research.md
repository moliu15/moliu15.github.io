## Research papers


[1] Heterogeneous Values of One Data Point: Active Label Acquisition in Assortment Optimization\\
**Mo Liu**, Junyu Cao, Zuo-jun Max Shen. To be resubmitted to _Management Science_. [ \[link\] ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4487888) [ \[Slides\] ](https://moliu15.github.io/files/INFORMS_value_of_information.pdf)


* **"How much is the marginal contribution to the revenue increase when adding one new customer with some specific feature into the training set?"** (Job market project)

* By evaluating this marginal contribution of each customer, we are able to identify informative customers and reduce the size of the training set by about 80% percent while maintaining the same level of revenue.


[2] Active Learning in the Predict-then-Optimize Framework: A Margin-Based Approach\\
**Mo Liu**, Paul Grigas, Heyuan Liu, Zuo-jun Max Shen. Under Review at _Management Science_. [ \[link\] ](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06584)[ \[Slides\] ](https://moliu15.github.io/files/MBALSPO_INFORMS_New.pdf)

* **"How to identify informative samples for the decision-making?"** (Job market project)
* **Best Student Paper Nominee at INFORMS Workshop on Data Science 2023**
* **Second Place Poster Prize at [YinzOR 2023](https://yinzor.cmuinforms.org/)**



[3] Learning from Click Transition Data: The Effectiveness of Greedy Pricing Policy under Dynamic Product Availability \\
**Mo Liu**, Junyu Cao, Zuo-jun Max Shen. To be submitted to _Management Science_. [ \[link\] ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4158054), [ \[**5-minute Talk**\] (Previous version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7igcUC2DZ9k&list=PLuvtfhwcPzCTnZg1SVdhT-uuUR1q1N7U6&index=16) [ \[Slides\] (Previous version) ](https://moliu15.github.io/files/5min_GMCCM_click_presentation.pdf)
* **Finalist at 2023 INFORMS Service Science Student Competition**
* **Fan Favoriate Flash Talk at [YinzOR 2023](https://yinzor.cmuinforms.org/)**


[4] End-to-End Deep Learning for Automatic Inventory Management with Fixed Ordering Cost \\
**Mo Liu**, Meng Qi, Zuo-jun Max Shen. _Working paper_. [ \[link\] ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3888897)


[5] Importance-Weighted Active Learning for Contextual Stochastic Optimization\\
**Mo Liu**, Paul Grigas, Zuo-jun Max Shen. _Woking paper._
